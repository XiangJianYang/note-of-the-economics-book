工资粘性和新凯恩斯主义（Sticky Wages and New Keynesian Economics）

费曼技巧是一种学习方法，它涉及用简单的术语解释一个概念，就像教别人一样，以确保深入理解。让我们将这种技巧应用于凯恩斯经济学和工资粘性概念。

**简化工资粘性和凯恩斯经济学**

想象一下你经营一个柠檬水摊。你根据制作柠檬水的成本和顾客愿意支付的价格来设定柠檬水的价格。现在，想象一下由于下了很多雨，想要柠檬水的人越来越少，需求突然下降。你会怎么做？理想情况下，你会降低价格以吸引更多的买家。但是，如果更改价格表会花费你的钱，或者你向柠檬水卖家承诺无论他们卖出多少杯，每小时都会获得一定数额的钱，该怎么办？

这种情况类似于工资“粘性”时经济中发生的情况。工资粘性意味着工资不会根据经济状况迅速变化。这种情况可能出于以下几个原因：

1. **菜单成本**：就像为柠檬水摊打印新的价格表需要花费成本一样，公司在改变工资时也需要花费成本。这些成本包括管理成本以及可能激怒那些抵制减薪的员工。

2. **劳动合同**：有时，工人会签订合同，在特定时期内固定他们的工资。即使公司希望因经济衰退而调整工资，他们也要等到合同到期才能调整。

当经济衰退时，价格通常会因为需求下降而下跌。如果工资没有下降得那么快（因为工资是固定的），工资的实际价值（你可以用工资买到的东西）就会上升。这对工人来说是好事，但对企业来说却不是好事。随着实际工资的提高，企业发现雇用工人的成本更高，导致他们雇用更少的人。结果，失业率上升。

老凯恩斯主义经济学认为，在经济衰退期间，政府应该介入并投入更多资金来刺激经济，创造就业机会。然而，批评者认为，如果每个人都期望政府总是提供帮助，那么人们可能会开始采取不同的行为，期待救助或刺激计划。这个想法被称为“理性预期”。

约翰·泰勒和格雷格·曼昆等新凯恩斯主义者出现并说：“等一下！即使人们理性行事并期待政府帮助，工资仍然可能僵化，政府干预仍然有效。”他们解释说，工资僵化并不一定意味着人们不理性；这只是一个实际问题。

因此，总而言之，工资僵化——就像柠檬水摊位上持续的高价——在经济困难时期会导致失业率上升。尽管人们理性行事并了解这些干预措施，但政府可以通过增加支出来创造就业机会来提供帮助。

通过将概念分解为更简单的术语并使用相关示例，我们应用了费曼技术来理解凯恩斯主义经济学和工资僵化的复杂性。

The Feynman technique is a method of learning that involves explaining a concept in simple terms, as if teaching it to someone else, to ensure deep understanding. Let's apply this technique to Keynesian economics and the concept of sticky wages.

**Sticky Wages and Keynesian Economics Simplified**

Imagine you're running a lemonade stand. You set the price of your lemonade based on how much it costs you to make it and what customers are willing to pay. Now, imagine there's a sudden drop in demand because it's been raining a lot, and fewer people want lemonade. What do you do? Ideally, you'd lower the price to attract more buyers. But what if changing the price list costs you money, or you've promised your lemonade sellers a certain amount of money per hour no matter how many cups they sell?

This scenario is similar to what happens in the economy when wages are "sticky." Sticky wages mean that wages don't change as quickly as they should in response to economic conditions. This can happen for a few reasons:

1. **Menu Costs**: Just like it costs you to print new price lists for your lemonade stand, companies have costs associated with changing wages. These include administrative costs and the potential for upsetting employees who might resist wage cuts.

2. **Labor Contracts**: Sometimes, workers have contracts that fix their wages for a specific period. Even if the company wants to adjust wages due to economic downturns, they can't until the contract ends.

When there's a recession, prices generally fall because demand drops. If wages don't fall as quickly (because they're sticky), the real value of wages (what you can buy with them) goes up. This is great for workers but not so great for businesses. With higher real wages, businesses find it more expensive to hire workers, leading them to hire fewer people. As a result, unemployment rises.

Older Keynesian economics said that during recessions, governments should step in and spend more money to boost the economy, creating jobs. However, critics argued that if everyone expected the government to always help, people might start behaving differently, expecting bailouts or stimulus packages. This idea is called "rational expectations."

New Keynesians like John Taylor and Greg Mankiw came along and said, "Wait a minute! Even if people act rationally and expect government help, wages can still be sticky, and government intervention can still work." They explained that stickiness in wages doesn't necessarily mean people are irrational; it's just a practical issue.

So, in summary, sticky wages—like stubbornly high prices on your lemonade stand—can lead to higher unemployment during tough economic times. Governments can help by spending more to create jobs, despite people acting rationally and knowing about these interventions.

By breaking down the concepts into simpler terms and using relatable examples, we've applied the Feynman technique to understand the complexities of Keynesian economics and sticky wages.

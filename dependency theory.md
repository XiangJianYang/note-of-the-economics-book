### 依赖理论（Dependency Theory）

费曼技巧是一种用简单术语解释复杂概念的方法，以物理学家理查德费曼的名字命名。让我们用这种方法来解释依赖理论。

依赖理论是经济学家安德烈·冈德·弗兰克在 20 世纪 60 年代提出的一个观点。它表明，富裕国家的政策，如自由贸易和投资，实际上有助于让较贫穷的国家保持贫困状态。

可以这样想：假设你有两个朋友，一个非常富有，一个非常贫穷。富有的朋友愿意借给穷朋友一些钱来创业。然而，贷款条款非常严格，利率也很高。穷朋友别无选择，只能接受贷款，因为他们需要钱来创业。随着时间的推移，穷朋友发现自己欠了富朋友的债，无法摆脱对富人的依赖。

同样，依赖理论表明，富裕国家向较贫穷的国家提供援助和投资，但条件是富裕国家比贫穷国家受益更多。这就造成了贫穷国家依赖富裕国家提供经济支持，而无法独立发展本国经济的情况。

简而言之，依赖理论认为，富国和穷国之间的关系不是互惠互利的关系，而是富国保持主导地位，而穷国由于依赖外部援助和投资而处于贫困状态。

The Feynman Technique is a method of explaining complex ideas in simple terms, named after physicist Richard Feynman. Let's use this technique to explain dependency theory.

Dependency theory is an idea proposed by economist Andre Gunder Frank in the 1960s. It suggests that the policies of wealthy countries, such as free trade and investment, actually contribute to keeping poorer countries in a state of poverty.

Think of it like this: imagine you have two friends, one who is very rich and one who is very poor. The rich friend offers to lend the poor friend some money to start a business. However, the terms of the loan are very strict and the interest rate is high. The poor friend has no choice but to accept the loan because they need the money to get started. Over time, the poor friend finds themselves in debt to the rich friend and unable to break free from their dependence on them.

Similarly, dependency theory suggests that wealthy countries offer aid and investment to poorer countries, but on terms that benefit the wealthy countries more than the poorer ones. This creates a situation where the poorer countries become dependent on the wealthier ones for economic support, rather than being able to develop their own economies independently.

In short, dependency theory argues that the relationship between wealthy and poorer countries is not one of mutual benefit, but rather one where the wealthy countries maintain their dominance and the poorer countries remain in a state of poverty due to their dependence on outside aid and investment.

### 不平衡的贸易（unbalanced trading）

让我们使用费曼技巧来简化全球经济如何分为富裕国家“核心”和贫穷国家“边缘”的概念，以及帮助发达国家发展的政策不一定能使当今的贫穷国家受益。

想象一群孩子在踢足球。在这场比赛中，有两支球队——“核心”队由多年来一直在一起踢球的技术娴熟的球员组成，而“边缘”队由较新、经验较少的球员组成。核心队拥有所有优势——他们了解彼此的优势和劣势，拥有更好的装备，也拥有更多的经验。另一方面，边缘队则在努力跟上。

同样，在全球经济中，有一些“核心”国家已经发展了很长时间，拥有所有优势——获得资本、技术和熟练劳动力。这些国家能够生产高价值的商品和服务，并以高价卖给其他国家。另一方面，有些“边缘”国家仍在发展中，缺乏许多这些优势。这些国家通常生产原材料，以低价卖给核心国家，然后以更高的价格回购成品。

经济学家经常认为，国际贸易自由化将有助于欠发达经济体，但依赖理论表明情况可能并非总是如此。较贫穷的国家在与更大、更富裕的国家进行贸易时，往往发现自己处于弱势谈判地位。他们被剥夺了可能有助于他们发展的优惠贸易条件，相反，他们被迫以低价出售原材料，以更高的价格回购成品。

此外，当富裕国家将工业和投资带到较贫穷的国家时，他们声称这将有助于贫穷国家经济增长。然而，实际上，当地资源经常被剥削，工人的工资很低，利润被分配给外国股东，而不是再投资到当地经济中。这阻碍了当地经济的投资和增长，使边缘国家难以赶上核心国家。

简而言之，依赖理论认为，全球经济可以分为富裕国家的“核心”和贫穷国家的“边缘”，帮助发达国家发展的政策不一定能使今天的贫穷国家受益。贫穷国家在与更大、更富裕的国家进行贸易时，往往处于弱势谈判地位，而对这些国家的投资往往不会带来可持续的经济增长。

Let's use the Feynman Technique to simplify the concept of how the global economy can be separated into a "core" of rich countries and a "periphery" of poor countries, and how policies that helped advanced countries develop may not necessarily benefit today's poor countries.

Imagine a group of kids playing a game of soccer. In this game, there are two teams - the "core" team made up of skilled players who have been playing together for years, and the "periphery" team made up of newer, less experienced players. The core team has all the advantages - they know each other's strengths and weaknesses, they have better equipment, and they have more experience. The periphery team, on the other hand, struggles to keep up.

Similarly, in the global economy, there are "core" countries that have been developed for a long time and have all the advantages - access to capital, technology, and skilled labor. These countries are able to produce high-value goods and services that they can sell to other countries at a premium. On the other hand, there are "periphery" countries that are still developing and lack many of these advantages. These countries often produce raw materials that they sell to the core countries at low prices, and then buy back finished goods at higher prices.

Economists often suggest that liberalizing international trade would help underdeveloped economies, but dependency theory suggests that this may not always be the case. Poorer countries often find themselves in a weak bargaining position when trading with larger, richer powers. They are denied favorable trading terms that could help them progress, and instead, they are forced to sell their raw materials at low prices and buy back finished goods at higher prices.

Furthermore, when richer countries bring industry and investment to poorer countries, they claim that they will help grow the poor countries' economies. However, in reality, local resources are often exploited, workers are poorly paid, and profits are distributed to foreign shareholders rather than being reinvested into the local economy. This discourages investment and growth in the local economy, making it difficult for the periphery countries to catch up to the core countries.

In short, dependency theory argues that the global economy can be separated into a "core" of rich countries and a "periphery" of poor countries, and that policies that helped advanced countries develop may not necessarily benefit today's poor countries. Poorer countries often find themselves in a weak bargaining position when trading with larger, richer powers, and investment in these countries often does not lead to sustainable economic growth.

### 另一条路线（an alternative route）

让我们用费曼技巧来分解这个概念，它涉及用简单、直接的方式解释复杂的想法。我们将讨论依赖理论、对它的批评以及亚洲四小龙和中国的对比例子。

### 1. 什么是依赖理论？

想象一下，你在一个教室里，有些学生拥有所有的教科书和资源，而其他学生却没有。拥有资源的学生成绩不断提高，而那些没有资源的学生则努力追赶。依赖理论是类似的；它表明，较贫穷的国家（我们称他们为“没有教科书的学生”）在贸易、投资和经济增长方面过于依赖较富裕的国家（拥有所有教科书的国家）。根据这种观点，富国剥削较贫穷的国家，使它们难以取得进步。

### 2. 依赖理论家认为问题是什么？

在依赖理论家看来，问题就像参加一场规则有利于那些已经领先一步的人的比赛。贫穷国家很难发展和致富，因为全球经济结构使它们处于依赖和不利地位。他们认为，当贫穷国家试图融入全球市场时，它们往往最终使富裕国家受益更多，而不是自己，就像在小组项目中做了所有艰苦的工作，但得到的赞誉却最少。

### 3. 亚洲四小龙和中国：不同的故事

现在，想象一下几个没有教科书的学生决定采取不同的方法。他们不再依赖其他人，而是开始分享笔记、一起学习，更有效地利用图书馆。突然间，他们也获得了最高分。这就是亚洲四小龙（香港、新加坡、台湾和韩国）和中国的情况。他们专注于开放国际贸易，吸引外资，并促进本国产业的发展。他们非但没有落后，反而迅速成长，成为经济强国。这挑战了依赖理论的观点，因为这些国家表明，参与全球经济可以带来成功和发展。

### 4. 辩论与反全球化运动

尽管亚洲四小龙和中国取得了成功，但关于经济发展的最佳道路仍然存在争议。一些人认为这些例子只是例外，许多其他国家尽管向世界开放，但仍在苦苦挣扎。这导致了反全球化运动，他们对国际贸易和投资持怀疑态度，担心它们往往以牺牲穷人为代价使富人受益。他们就像那些谨慎的学生，看到别人分享笔记，但仍然表现不佳，所以他们质疑这是否是适合所有人的正确策略。

总之，依赖理论批评全球经济体系偏袒富国，而让穷国处于依赖和不利地位。然而，亚洲四小龙和中国的崛起提出了一个反驳，表明战略性地参与全球经济可以带来快速发展和增长。正在进行的辩论反映了关于如何在复杂而相互关联的世界中最好地实现经济进步的不同观点。

Alright, let’s break down the concept using the Feynman Technique, which involves explaining complex ideas in a simple, straightforward way. We’re going to talk about dependency theory, its criticisms, and the contrasting example of the Asian Tigers and China.

### 1. What is Dependency Theory?

Imagine you’re in a classroom where some students have all the textbooks and resources, while others don’t have any. The students with the resources keep getting better grades, while those without struggle to catch up. Dependency theory is similar; it suggests that poorer countries (let’s call them “the students without textbooks”) depend too much on richer countries (the ones with all the textbooks) for trade, investment, and economic growth. According to this view, the rich countries exploit the poorer ones, making it hard for them to get ahead.

### 2. What’s the Problem According to Dependency Theorists?

The problem, as seen by dependency theorists, is like being in a race where the rules favor those who already have a head start. Poor countries find it difficult to develop and become wealthy because the global economy’s structure keeps them dependent and at a disadvantage. They argue that when poor countries try to integrate into the global market, they often end up benefiting the rich countries more than themselves, like doing all the hard work in a group project but getting the least credit.

### 3. The Asian Tigers and China: A Different Story

Now, imagine a few students without textbooks decide to take a different approach. Instead of relying on the others, they start to share notes, study together, and use the library more effectively. Suddenly, they’re getting top grades, too. This is what happened with the Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea) and China. They focused on opening up to international trade, attracting foreign investment, and boosting their own industries. Instead of being left behind, they grew rapidly and became economic powerhouses. This challenges the dependency theory’s view because these countries showed that engaging with the global economy can lead to success and development.

### 4. The Debate and Anti-Globalization Movements

Despite the success stories of the Asian Tigers and China, there’s still a debate about the best path for economic development. Some people argue that these examples are exceptions and that many other countries have struggled despite opening up to the world. This has led to anti-globalization movements, which are skeptical of international trade and investment, fearing that they often benefit the rich at the expense of the poor. They’re like the cautious students who’ve seen others share notes and still not do well, so they question whether it’s the right strategy for everyone.

In summary, dependency theory criticizes the global economic system for favoring rich countries and keeping poorer ones in a dependent and disadvantaged position. However, the rise of the Asian Tigers and China offers a counterargument, suggesting that strategic engagement with the global economy can lead to rapid development and growth. The ongoing debate reflects differing views on how best to achieve economic progress in a complex and interconnected world.
